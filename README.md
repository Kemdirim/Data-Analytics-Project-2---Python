# Data-Analytics-Project-2---Python
Wrangle and Analyse Data (Web scraping)
My goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning was required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.
How to Query Twitter Data
In this project, I used Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This additional data will include retweet count and favorite count.
